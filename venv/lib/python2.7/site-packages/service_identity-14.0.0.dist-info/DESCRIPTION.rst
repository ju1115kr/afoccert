**TL;DR**: Use this package if you use pyOpenSSL_ and don’t want to be MITM_\ ed.

``service_identity`` aspires to give you all the tools you need for verifying whether a certificate is valid for the intended purposes.

In the simplest case, this means *host name verification*.
However, ``service_identity`` implements `RFC 6125`_ fully and plans to add other relevant RFCs too.

``service_identity``\ ’s documentation lives at `Read the Docs <https://service-identity.readthedocs.org/>`_, the code on `GitHub <https://github.com/pyca/service_identity>`_.
